# Developing the Airbnb form.

I have long liked the Airbnb website. It has quite a few interesting elements that I have always
wanted to try creating myself. In this project, I decided to practice developing forms by creating a
filter form like Airbnb's. This form has the most common inputs, which will serve as good practice
for me. Also, when developing the previous
form ([Survey form](https://github.com/chasowska/survey-form)), I found it quite difficult to
create custom inputs,
so here I will try to reinforce the knowledge I have gained before. In addition, I decided to
develop a header like Airbnb's to work with more complex hover effects.

### My personal tasks

1. Develop the Airbnb filters form.
2. Create the Airbnb header.
3. Add hover effect to the header where the search field will completely change.
4. Learning to create the effect of gradually disappearing text with the appearance of 3 dots upon
   screen compression (implemented in the header).
